    "Background: A number n is a right-truncatable prime, or RTP, if every prefix of n (including n itself) are all prime. So, 593 is an RTP because 5, 59, and 593 are all prime. With this in mind, write the function `findRTP(digits)` that takes a positive int, digits, and returns the smallest RTP with that many digits, or None if no such number exists. To do this, you must use backtracking even if you could do it in some other way. At each step, try to add one more digit to the right of the number. Also, make sure you are only creating RTP's as you go. Note: even though findRTP(8) returns 23399339, it runs almost instantly because backtracking rules out most numbers without trying them, so it actually calls isPrime very few times.\n",

The boards will be given to the function as a string of periods, O's, and spaces, which represent holes, pegs, and invalid spaces respectively (see examples below). The result should be returned as a list of moves to be made in the form (fromRow, fromCol, toRow, toCol), which indicates which piece to pick up (the from piece) and where it goes (the to piece). Your function must give the answer in a reasonable amount of time, which is defined as 10 seconds.\n",
